        <h1>BLACK-BACKED JACKAL</h1>
        <img src="black backed jackal.jpeg">
        <p>The black-backed jackal is a member of the dog family.It has a rusty red coat with a<br>black patch on its back and a black-tipped tail.It measure around 95 centimetres(37<br>inches)from head to tail.</p>
        <p>As opportunistic omnivores,jackals can eat what they want.They work in family parks to<br>hunt small antelopes,but they'll also feed on reptiles,insects,birds,fruits,berries and<br>carcasses left by larger predators.</p>
        <p>There are two distinct populations of black-backed jackals in Africa-one in East Africa,<br>in countries including Kenya,Ethiopia and Tanzania and one in Southern africa in<br>countries including Namibia,Angola and South africa</p>
        <p>These animals live in a wide variety of habitats,from deserts to grasslands to savannahs.<br>The IUNC lists black-backed jackals as least concern,meaning they face few threats.<br>However,they are hunted by farmers who kill them to protect their livestock.</p>
