        <img src="dik-diks.jpeg">
        <p>The dik-dik is a type of dwarf antelope that lives in arid regions of East Africa.They can<br>live in such barren environments because they get water from the vegatation they eat.<br>They also take cover in undergrowth to protect themselves from predators,including<br>eagles and cats</p>
        <p>There are four species of dik-diks,but just two of them live in Kenya.These include<br>Guenther's dik-dik and Kirk's dik-dik.Kirk's is the largest dik-dik,though it's still small<br>in comparison to other antelopes.It stands at just 45 centimetres(18 inches)tall and<br>weighs only 7.2 kilograms(15.8 pounds).Guenther's dik-dik is smaller but has a longer<br>snout.</p>
        <p>The IUNC lists both Kirk's dik-dik and Guenther's dik-dik at least concern,though they are<br>threatened by expanding agricultural settlements and excessive hunting in some areas.</p>
