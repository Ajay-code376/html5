        <h1>CHEETAH</h1>
        <img src="cheetah.jpeg" alt="a cheetah in the savannah">
        <p>One of the most recognizable animals in Kenya is the cheetah.These spotty cats-each<br>with their own unique patterns-are skilled hunters,in part because of their natural<br>speed and agility.In fact,cheetahs are the fastest mammals on earth.They can accelerate<br>from zero to 60 miles per hour in just three seconds. Another interesting cheeetah fact?<br>Unlike lions,tigers,jaguars and leopards and cheetahs can't roar-they can only purr.</p>
        <p>These cats live and hunt in open grasslands across Africa.They can be found in<br>countries including Kenya,Algeria,South africa and Niger.</p>
        <p>The International Union for the Conservation of Nature(IUCN)classes cheetahs<br>as vulnerable.This means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild.There are<br>just 6,517 mature cheetahs left in the wild and their population is decreasing.Cheetahs are<br>at particular risk from habitat loss because they need such a large range.Most cheetahs<br>live in unprotected areas,where they come into conflict with farmers.</p>
