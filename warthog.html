        <h1>DESERT WARTHOG</h1>
        <img src="warthog.jpeg">
        <p>The desert warthog is a member of the pig family.It has a large warty head,a coarse<br>mane and two pairs of tusks.Unlike the common warthog,which can be found across<br>most of Africa,the desert warthog only lives in Kenya,Ethiopia and Somalia.It lives in<br>savannah and shrubland habitats,where it feeds on grass and other vegetation and uses<br>abandoned aardvark burrows as a place to shelter.</p>
        <p>The desert warthog is listed by the IUCN as least concern.However,the population faces<br>several risks in Kenya,including growing human and livestock numbers.This increases<br>competition for both water and food.</p>
