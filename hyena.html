        <h1>HYENA</h1>
        <img src="hyena.jpeg">
        <p>There are two species of hyenas in Kenya-the striped hyena and the spotted hyena<br>They can be found throughout Africa,in all habitats except rainforests.</p>
        <p>The spotted hyena(also called the laughing hyena)is the largest hyena species,with the<br>females being larger than the males.Their coats are patterned with dark spots.These</p>
        <p>animals hunt fish,birds and even hippo calves and can work in parks to take<br>down wildbeests or antelopes.</p>
        <p>Stripped hyenas are lesser known than their spotted cousins.They are more scavengers<br>than hunters and typically come out at night to feed on carcasses left to other animals.</p>
        <p>The spotted hyena is listed by the IUCN at least concern and the stripped hyena is near<br>threatened.Human-wildlife conflict is the main threat to their survival.</p>
