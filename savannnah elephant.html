        <p>The African savannah elephant is the world's largest land mammal.It lives across many<br>different habitats,including open savannahs,deserts and forests.<br>As these animals roam,they play an important role within their ecosystems.<br>They disperse seeds through their</p>
        <p>dung.helping to fertilise the land;theyclear paths through vegetation and overgrown<br>bush,promoting plant diversity;and they use their tusks and feet to access water in dry<br>riverbeds,creating small watering holes for other animals.</p>
        <p>African savannah elephants are found in 23 countries across Africa.They have large<br>populations in Kenya,Botswana,Namibia,Tanzania,South Africa,Zambia and<br>Zimbabwe.</p>
        <p>The IUCN classifies the African savannah elephant as endagered.This means it is at a<br>very high risk of extinction in the wild.Their numbers are also decreasing.These<br>elephants are poached for their ivory and their natural habitats are being converted into<br>agricultural land and infrastructure by expanding human populations.</p>
        <p>IFAW is working to protect African savannah elephants and conserve their remaining<br>habitat through ur Room to Roam initiative.</p>
